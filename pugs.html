        <p class="pugkennel sedgwick-ave-regular">

            Keevah is one of the lovely females in our kennel. She's a beautiful
            girl with a striking coat of chocolate and tan points- taking after her father,
            Turbo, and an incrediblly sweet temperament. Keevah is a true family dog-
            she loves nothing more than lounging around with us and soaking up all the belly
            rubs she can get! Smart and affectionate, she brings a lot of joy and warmth
            to our lives.
